# Stock Price Predicition with LSTM

Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Algorithm. This prediction model build based on the historical stock price data. For example, the 60-day historical as an input used to predict the price at 61st day. The model built with Keras Sequential model with Dense and LSTM as its neuron layers.

v2:
- Use Keras Functional API for the model.
- Logged return variable added for training model.
- Retuning the model because new variable added.
